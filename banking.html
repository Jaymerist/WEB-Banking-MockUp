                    <p>Deciding between an RRSP and a TFSA can be a tough call, but don't worry, we're here to help! RRSPs are great for saving for retirement, and any contributions you make are tax-deductible. TFSAs, on the other hand, are perfect for short-term savings goals, like a down payment on a house or a dream vacation, and your money grows tax-free.</p>
